          <strong>solarpunk:</strong> an emerging culture and arts movement which envisions a
          regenerative future interconnected with community and nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>solarpunk pen pals:</strong> a collaborative storytelling activity where you
          imagine a solarpunk world, create a character in it, then write a letter as your
          character.
        </p>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          In pairs of two you will be guided through a process of collaborative worldbuilding and
          character creation similar to preparing for a roleplaying game. In fact, the prompt cards
          are borrowed from an RPG,
          <a href="https://thefuture.wtf/" target="_blank">Solarpunk Futures</a>. However, in this
          activity, instead of playing a game with your characters, your characters will write each
          other letters updating each other on their lives within their solarpunk world.

        <br />

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download and print the
            <a href="cards.pdf" target="_blank">cards</a> (1 copy) and
            <a href="charactersheets.pdf" target="_blank">character sheets</a> (1 copy per 2
            players). Optional: Print a hardcopy of the
            <a href="instructions.pdf" target="_blank">instructions</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Gather a pen or pencil for each player</li>
          <li>Form pairs of 2</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Phase 1: Worldbuilding</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Setting the scene:</strong> We will be imagining our world 20 years in the future.
          The solarpunk transition has critical momentum – people are actively building the better
          and dismantling the bad.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1em">As a pair:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pull a Challenge Card and a Tool Card.</li>
          <li>
            Take 5 minute turns riffing on how your Challenge might be met with your Tool. If at
            first your Challenge and Tool seem unrelated, just try your best and see where your
            imagination takes you. Remember to think local. Discuss how your visions interrelate in
            the future you’re co-imagining.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Tip: Get specific applying these ideas to your familiar communities and
            locales.</strong
          >
          <i
            >For instance you can start with “Parking lots are replaced with community gardens” but
            then take the next step to say “the parking lot behind Trader Joe’s is being converted
            to a community garden by…” You don’t have to be an expert - go on a flight of fancy.</i
          >
        </p>

        <h2>Phase 2: Character Creation</h2>
        <p>Individually:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Take a Character Sheet.</li>
          <li>
            Pull a Value Card and Role Card. Write these down on your character sheet as your
            character’s “Motivating Value” and “Movement Role”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using your value and role as inspiration, fill out the rest of your character sheet.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Phase 3: Relationship Building</h2>
        <p>As a pair:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Introduce each other to your characters.</li>
          <li>Decide how your characters know each other and why they are in correspondence.</li>
          <li>
            Write a letter from your character to your partner’s character, drawing from the
            worldbuilding and character creation that you’ve done together. Feel free to leave out
            whatever doesn’t feel relevant. Don’t consult each other while writing.
          </li>
          <li>Read each other your letters.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion: Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          As a whole group: Share the letters you have written.
          <i>If it’s a large group, be mindful to keep the backstory to a minimum.</i>

                  issues in the zeitgeist and presented at the local farmers market.

                <p>
                  I came across the most magnificent faucet last Tuesday amidst my weekly timemorate
                  gathering, and couldn't help but be reminded of you, your equisite faucet
                  collection and what you do for 70% of our posterity, the percentage of us that is
                  made of WATER! HAH! Oh don't mind me and my grandparently humor. How the old world
                  of science shows on cable TV. Remember back when we all spent a chunk of our
                  lives, a chunk of TIME focused on a little black box? Now that our intention (the
                  one you and I created, where beauty, advocacy, information and social connection
                  is gamified through intentional exercsises for all at the daily locals Market) is
                  widespread across our watershed, science jokes are born in the community, rather
                  than aroudn the producer's table. Oh how I miss the days of our madly intnetional
                  dreaming and madly love-filled soundbaths amidst the trees. Let's get together and
                  create again, my friend. These old bones haven't stopped me from expanding the
                  soundbath to include refractive prisms you would love! And hey, now I am in need
                  of a new faucet soon. See you in our dreams ❤️.

                <p>Hey Jesus!</p>
                <p>
                  It was so nice meeting you at the Santa Cruz Annual Seed Convention. I hope the
                  lupine seeds are serving your project well. May teir roots tangle with your
                  riparian ecosystem to make supportive soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your cosmic citrus seeds have sprouted and are now a good foot tall. I'm excited
                  to try their fruit in the future. Is it true that they can produce fruit in only a
                  year? That seems... unnatural. Almost uncomfortably so. I'm trying to analyze why
                  this feeling stays with me. I think in the past, the length of time I spend with a
                  tree and see its growth makes it feel special. Not in a big dopamine rush of
                  instant gratification, but in the way a relationship with a very old and stable
                  friend feels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also see, however, how beneficial these fast-growing fruit trees can be for
                  people. I think in unison with other food growing plants of vary abilities, we can
                  make healthy ecosystems that benefit the environment and people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would love to collaborate with you with this in mind. I knkow you mentioned you
                  work at a hospital. Would you be interested in collaborating on a food garden for
                  sick and disabled people?

                <p>
                  That theory your provided was radical, I appreciate that seed perspecctive.
                  That'll help me refine my model on seed difussion across regions. It's cool to
                  think about how we can map Agro seed highways (spread of seeds). Allergies suck -
                  people should be able to experience nature without constantly sneezing! Boo
                  allergies.
